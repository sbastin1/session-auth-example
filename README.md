# Session Auth Example in Nuxt

## Summary

This is a sort of "raw" implementation of Session Auth without using any external libraries. <br>
The only external library being used is Json Server as a "mock db" with RestApi Endpoints. <br>

> In a real world scenario you would obviously replace json-server with a proper database.
